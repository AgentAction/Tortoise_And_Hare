*Story*
Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a hare named Jagoo and a tortoise named Bhagoo. They accidently met once in the
forest and decided to have a racing competition. Jagoo thought that Bhagoo would definitely lose the race. But the real
action happens on the race track. On Sunday morning, the race track was surrounded by the Jungle animals. Sher Khan, the
king of the forest, reavaled the trophy that was to be given to the winner. Monku sold the tickets to the animals to watch
the race.
